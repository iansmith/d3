d3
==

Thin wrapper over the [data-driven documents (d3)](http://d3js.org/) 
library for use with [gopherjs](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs).

This is just enough of the d3 library to allow you to complete the
[Mark Bostock's excellent tutorial](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/),
but writing [entirely in go](https://github.com/iansmith/d3/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial.go).  

The calls are not very regularized because they haven't been thought through
with respect to statically-typed programming model.

Install
=======
```
go get -u github.com/iansmith/d3
````

Check out the [demo](http://iansmith.github.io/d3).
